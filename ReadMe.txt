Unfortunately I did not have time to organize the file in a manner that it is easy to know which page comes first
thefore I'll try to do as much as I can to explain it here


The website starts with the "home.html" page. This page has two buttons
that link to the "anime.html and "games.html" pages respectively

Each picture on the anime and game page link to the information page related to the picture

I have also included some of the fonts that may nedd to be installed 
to properly view the page.

Thanks,
Argha
