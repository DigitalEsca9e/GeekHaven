				<h1><a name="sory">Overview</a></h1>
				<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 4 (stylized as Call of Duty: Black Ops IIII) is a multiplayer first-person shooter developed by 
				Treyarch and published by Activision. It was released worldwide for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One on 
				October 12, 2018. It is a sequel to the 2015 game Call of Duty: Black Ops III, the fifth entry in the Black Ops sub-series, 
				and the 15th installment in the Call of Duty series overall.</p>
				<p>Black Ops 4 is the first Call of Duty title without a traditional single-player campaign mode. Instead, it features 
				the Solo Missions mode, which focuses on the backstories of the game's multiplayer characters, known as "Specialists". 
				The missions take place between Black Ops II and III chronologically. Some of the Specialists also carried over from Black Ops 
				III. The multiplayer mode is the first in the series to not feature automatic health regeneration and introduces both predictive 
				recoil and a new ballistics system. The game includes three Zombies maps on release day, four if a special edition of the game, 
				or the Black Ops Pass, is purchased. The locations of the maps include the RMS Titanic, an arena in Ancient Rome, and Alcatraz 
				Federal Penitentiary. The game also introduces a battle royale mode called Blackout, which features up to 100 players in each match.
				Many characters from this and other Black Ops titles can be used as the player's character model in this mode.</p>

				<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 4 is a multiplayer first-person shooter video game. Unlike previous titles in the Call of Duty series, 
				Black Ops 4 is the first entry to not feature a traditional single-player campaign, and contains only Multiplayer, Zombies a
				nd a new battle royale mode called Blackout.</p>
				<p>Black Ops 4's multiplayer features the return of Specialists, unique soldier characters with special abilities and traits. 
				The game features a total of ten Specialists, six of which (Ruin, Prophet, Battery, Seraph, Nomad, Firebreak) are returning 
				characters from Black Ops III, while the other four (Recon, Ajax, Torque, Crash) are new additions. It will also feature remakes 
				of five fan-favorite maps, Jungle, Slums, Summit, Firing Range and Nuketown. Treyarch stated that the maps will be available 
				to all players at launch except Nuketown which will arrive in November.</p>
				<p>Zombies returns as the cooperative multiplayer mode for Black Ops 4. The game mode features a wider range of customization, 
				allowing for more personalized play styles. Mechanics of the game can be customized via "Custom Mutations", which include 
				over 100 variables, such as overall difficulty, zombie speed, health, damage, and more. Time-limited events known as "Callings" 
				are also promised to be included in the game for long-term engagement. Similar to the Nazi Zombies mode in Call of Duty: WWII, 
				custom loadouts are included to allow players to select different starting weapons, equipment and special upgradable weapons, 
				as well as perk selection to be available in each match. A new game type, Rush, is introduced into Zombies, where the players 
				build up points and multipliers and compete against one another for the highest point possible until death.</p>
				<p>Black Ops 4 features a battle royale game mode called Blackout which will serve as a stand-in for the campaign mode. 
				While utilizing the traditional Black Ops combat style, the mode includes the largest map featured in a Call of Duty title. 
				Players compete against each other through locations appeared in previous Black Ops games. This mode will also feature land, 
				sea, and air vehicles for players to use. The game mode features various playable characters from the entire Black Ops series, 
				such as Alex Mason from the original game, Raul Menendez from Black Ops II, and the Primis crew from Zombies.</p>

				<h1><a name="mng">Reception</a></h1>
				<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 4 received "generally favorable" reviews across all platforms according to review aggregator Metacritic.</p>
				<p>In its 9.5/10 review, Game Informer wrote: "Call of Duty: Black Ops 4 makes a sacrifice that's sure to be off-putting to some with 
				the lack of a campaign, but the surrender of tradition comes with sweeping and significant benefits. Blackout is the best 
				battle-royale experience available today, zombies offers crazy customizable co-op, and multiplayer keeps things grounded for those 
				looking for the classic core." Electronic Gaming Monthly gave the game 8.5/10, writing: "Call of Duty: Black Ops 4 has made some bold
				changes to the series, and ultimately, they're for the better. The inclusion of a battle royale mode is a first, and even the more 
				familiar multiplayer and Zombies survival mode are not what they once were. Changes are always risky, but in Black Ops 4's case, 
				it worked out for the better." IGN wrote that "Black Ops 4 has a few rough edges, but any of its three modes make for an enjoyable 
				shooter experience that feel distinct and personalized." It gave separate reviews for each mode with Blackout receiving then highest 
				at 9/10, Zombies with 8.5/10 and the Multiplayer with 7.8/10. The whole game was given a score of 8.5/10.</p>
