				<h1><a name="sory">Plot</a></h1>
				<p>On an unnamed Earth-like super-continent planet, powerful monsters and villains have been mysteriously 
				appearing and causing disasters. To combat them, the world's government has created a Hero Association that
				employs superheroes to try and stop the violent creatures and villains. Each of the Hero Association's 
				superheroes are ranked from Class-C to Class-S. Saitama is an unranked hero, hailing from the metropolis
				of City-Z, who performs heroic deeds for his own entertainment. He has trained himself and grown strong to 
				the point where he can effortlessly defeat any opponent with a single punch. However, since Saitama became 
				a hero for the fun of the experience, he has lately become bored with his superhuman power, and frustrated at the
				complete lack of strong opponents that can challenge him.</p>
				<p>Over the course of the series, Saitama encounters various superheroes, villains, and monsters. He quickly 
				gains a pupil that is a cyborg, Genos, who is on a revenge quest to find another cyborg that slaughtered his 
				entire family and hometown. Eventually the two join the Hero Association in order to gain official recognition.
				Genos proves to be a prodigy and is instantly placed in Class-S, while Saitama barely passes the written test
				and is therefore placed in last place of Class-C, making him the lowest ranked hero. Saitama performs many feats
				that go mostly unnoticed and unappreciated by the public, such as defeating the ninja, Speed of Sound Sonic, and
				destroying an incoming meteor that was going to obliterate City Z. Saitama is promoted to Class-B, after he 
				defeats the powerful Deep Sea King, who reigns destruction on City J. Monsters begin to appear in City-Z, searching
				for a mysterious Monster Association. Soon after, the great seer,Shibabawa, has a vision that the world is in 
				danger. Panicking, the Hero Association calls all S-Class heroes to a meeting, begging them to protect the world.
				Immediately after the meeting, the powerful alien leader of the Dark Matter Thieves, Boros, invades the planet and
				destroys City-A. Saitama duels with Boros and defeats him by using a serious punch. During the invasion of aliens,
				the S-Class hero, Drive Knight, warns Genos that the S-Class hero, Metal Knight, is his enemy. The Hero Association
				salvages City-A with the help of Metal Knight, and they build a new base of operations that will allow the Hero 
				Association to deploy heroes more easily.</p>
