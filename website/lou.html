				<h1><a name="anim">Gameplay</a></h1>
				<p>The Last of Us is an action-adventure survival horror game played from a third-person perspective. The player traverses 
				across post-apocalyptic environments such as towns, buildings, forest and sewers to advance the story. The player can use firearms, 
				improvised weapons, and stealth to defend against hostile humans and cannibalistic creatures infected by a mutated strain of the 
				Cordyceps fungus. For most of the game, the player takes control of Joel, a man tasked with escorting a young girl, Ellie, 
				across the United States; Ellie and other companions are controlled by the artificial intelligence. The player also controls 
				Ellie throughout the game's winter segment.</p>
				<p>In combat, the player can use long-range weapons, such as rifles, shotguns, and bows, and short-range weapons such as handguns
				and short-barreled shotgun. The player is able to scavenge limited-use melee weapons, such as pipes and baseball bats, and throw 
				bottles and bricks to distract, stun, or attack enemies. The player can upgrade weapons at workbenches using collected items. 
				Equipment such as health kits and Molotov cocktails can be found or crafted using collected items. Attributes such as the health
				meter and crafting speed can be upgraded by collecting pills and medicinal plants. Health can be recharged through the 
				use of health kits.</p>
				<p>Though the player can attack enemies directly, they can also use stealth to attack undetected or sneak by them. "Listen Mode"
				allows the player to locate enemies through a heightened sense of hearing and spatial awareness, indicated as outlines visible through
				walls and objects. In the dynamic cover system, the player can crouch behind obstacles to gain a tactical advantage during combat.
				The game features periods without combat, often involving conversation between the characters. The player can solve simple puzzles,
				such as using floating pallets to move Ellie, who is unable to swim, across bodies of water, and using ladders or dumpsters to reach 
				higher areas. Story collectibles, such as notes, maps and comics, can be scavenged and viewed in the backpack menu.</p>
				<p>The online multiplayer allows up to eight players to engage in competitive gameplay in recreations of multiple single-player 
				settings. The game features three multiplayer game types: Supply Raid and Survivors are both team deathmatches, with the latter 
				excluding the ability to respawn; Interrogation features teams investigating the location of the enemy team's lockbox, and the first 
				to capture such lockbox wins. In every mode, players select a faction—Hunters (a group of hostile survivors) or Fireflies 
				(a revolutionary militia group)—and keep their clan alive by collecting supplies during matches. Each match is equal to one day; 
				by surviving twelve "weeks", players have completed a journey and can re-select their Faction. Killing enemies, reviving allies, 
				and crafting items earn the player parts that can be converted to supplies; parts can also be scavenged from enemies' bodies. Players 
				are able to carry more equipment by earning points as their clan's supplies grow. Players can connect the game to their Facebook 
				account, which alters clan members' names and faces to match the players' Facebook friends. Players have the ability to customize 
				their characters with hats, helmets, masks, and emblems.</p>
