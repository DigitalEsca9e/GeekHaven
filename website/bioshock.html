				<h1><a name="sory">Overview</a></h1>
				<p>BioShock Infinite is a first-person shooter video game developed by Irrational Games and published by 2K Games. It was 
				released worldwide for the Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360 platforms on March 26, 2013; an OS X port by Aspyr 
				was later released on August 29, 2013 and a Linux port was released on March 17, 2015. Infinite is the third installment in 
				the BioShock series, and though it is not immediately part of the storyline of previous BioShock games, it features similar 
				gameplay concepts and themes. Irrational Games and creative director Ken Levine based the game's setting on historical events
				at the turn of the 20th century, such as the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition, and based the story on the concept of American 
				exceptionalism, while also incorporating influences from more recent events at the time such as the 2011 Occupy movement.</p>
				<p>The game is set in the year 1912 and follows its protagonist, former Pinkerton agent Booker DeWitt, who is sent to the 
				airborne city of Columbia to find a young woman, Elizabeth, who has been held captive there for most of her life. Though 
				Booker rescues Elizabeth, the two become involved with the city's warring factions: the nativist and elite Founders that 
				rule Columbia and strive to keep its privileges for White Americans, and the Vox Populi, underground rebels representing the 
				underclass of the city. During this conflict, Booker learns that Elizabeth possesses strange powers to manipulate "Tears" 
				in the space-time continuum that ravage Columbia, and soon discovers her to be central to the city's dark secrets.</p>

				<h1><a name="anim">Gameplay</a></h1>
				<p>Like BioShock and BioShock 2, BioShock Infinite is a first-person shooter with role-playing elements. In contrast to the 
				limited spaces of Rapture in previous BioShock games, the expanded environment of Columbia provides for more dynamic combat 
				challenges in Infinite. As Booker, the player must fight their way through Columbia using weapons and a variety of tools 
				in order to complete objectives. The player may carry only two weapons at a time, and can collect other weapons and ammunition
				either from defeated enemies or from random locations around the city. In addition to his health, Booker is also equipped with 
				a shield. When damaged, the shield regenerates after a few seconds, while health can be replenished with medical kits or food.
				Should Booker die, the player revives in a safe area but loses a slight amount of money; Booker regains partial health and 
				is granted additional ammunition, while local enemies are also partially healed. Players can still recover from death should 
				they lose all their money.</p>
				<p>Booker gains powers and abilities through Vigors, Gears, and Infusions, all scattered around Columbia. Vigors, the equivalent
				of BioShock's Plasmids, grant activated powers such as creating shockwaves, releasing bolts of electricity, and machine/human
				possession. Vigors require Salt, the equivalent of magic points or BioShock's EVE, for powering their abilities. Salts can be found 
				throughout Columbia, and are also granted upon death. Wearing Gears grant passive abilities that can improve the player's 
				strength or damage resistance, similar in function to BioShock's Tonics. Each piece of Gear attaches to one of four specific slots:
				Hats, Shirts, Boots, and Pants. Only one piece of Gear can be affixed to a slot at a time; any extra Gear is stored in the player's
				inventory. Infusions grant the ability to permanently boost the player's health, Salts or shield meter by one stat; they also fully 
				restore whatever is being boosted.</p>
				<p>At certain points throughout the story, the player will be forced to make a choice in order to continue, each choice making minor 
				changes on the story. For example, at a raffle at the start of the game, Booker wins and the raffle is revealed to be a front for 
				a public stoning of an interracial couple. As a reward for winning the raffle, Booker is given the very first throw, and the player 
				is given a choice to throw at the couple or at the announcer. If the player chooses the latter option, the couple appears later to 
				thank him for sparing them, but if the player chooses the former option, the announcer congratulates him later in the game.</p>

				<h1><a name="mng">Reception</a></h1>
				<p>BioShock Infinite received critical acclaim upon release, with reviewers particularly praising the story, setting and visual art 
				design. Aggregating review website GameRankings gave BioShock Infinite an average rating of 96% based on 17 reviews for the PlayStation 
				3 version, 93% based on 39 reviews for the PC version, and 92% based on 27 reviews for the Xbox 360 version. Metacritic gave the game a 
				score of 94/100 from 27 critics for the PlayStation 3 version, 94/100 from 68 critics for the PC version, and 93/100 from 33 critics for 
				the Xbox 360 version, with all three platform versions of the game considered to be of "universal acclaim." According to Metacritic, 
				BioShock Infinite was the third-highest rated video game of 2013 across all platforms, behind Grand Theft Auto V and The Last of Us.</p>
				<p>Consensus among several critics was that BioShock Infinite was one of the best games of the seventh generation era of video game consoles,
				with IGN's Ryan McCaffery praising the game as "a brilliant shooter that nudges the entire genre forward with innovations in both storytelling
				and gameplay." Joe Juba of Game Informer stated that Infinite was among the best games he had ever played, while PlayStation Universe's Adam 
				Dolge called it "one of the best first-person shooters ever made." Identifying it as a "masterpiece that will be discussed for years to come," 
				Joel Gregory of PlayStation Official Magazine concluded that Infinite was the latest game to join the hallowed ranks of Half-Life, Deus Ex 
				and BioShock as "the apotheosis of the narrative-driven shooter." Even the usually acerbic Zero Punctuation critic Ben "Yahtzee" Croshaw 
				named it the best game of 2013, saying that he was still thinking about the game's ending months after having played it.</p>
