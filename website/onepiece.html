				<h1><a name="sory">Plot</a></h1>
				<p>The series focuses on Monkey D. Luffy, a young man who, inspired by his childhood idol and powerful 
				pirate "Red Haired" Shanks, sets off on a journey from the East Blue Sea to find the famed treasure One 
				Piece and proclaim himself the King of the Pirates. In an effort to organize his own crew, the Straw Hat 
				Pirates (麦わら海賊団篇 Mugiwara Kaizoku-danhen), Luffy rescues and befriends a swordsman named Roronoa Zoro,
				and they head off in search of the One Piece. They are joined in their journey by Nami, a navigator and 
				thief; Usopp, a sniper and a liar; and Sanji, a womanizing chef. They acquire a ship named the Going Merry 
				and engage in confrontations with notorious pirates of the East Blue. As Luffy and his crew set out on their
				adventures, others join the crew later in the series, including Tony Tony Chopper, a doctor and 
				anthropomorphized reindeer; Nico Robin, an archaeologist and former assassin; Franky, a cyborg shipwright;
				Brook, a skeletal musician; and Jimbei, a fishman helmsman; and they also acquire a new ship named the 
				Thousand Sunny.</p>
				<p>The world of One Piece is populated by humans and many other races such as "fishmen" (a race of 
				fish/human hybrids, similar to mermen and mermaids), dwarves, Minkmen (a race of humanoid animals), and giants. 
				It is covered by two vast oceans, which are divided by a massive mountain range called the Red Line 
				(赤い土の大陸レッドライン Reddo Rain), which is also the only continent in the world. The Grand Line 
				(偉大なる航路グランドライン Gurando Rain), a sea that runs perpendicular to the Red Line, further divides them 
				into four seas: North Blue (北の海ノースブルー Nōsu Burū), East Blue (東の海イーストブルー Īsuto Burū), West Blue
				(西の海ウェストブルー Uesuto Burū) and South Blue (南の海サウスブルー Sausu Burū). Surrounding the Grand Line are 
				two regions called Calm Belts (凪の帯カームベルト kāmu beruto), similar to horse latitudes, which experience almost
				no wind or ocean currents and are the breeding ground for huge sea creatures called sea kings (海王類 kaiōrui, 
				lit. "sea kings"). Because of this, the calm belts are very effective barriers for those trying to enter the 
				Grand Line. However, navy ships, members of an intergovernmental organization known as the World Government,
				are able to use a sea-prism stone (海楼石 kairōseki) to mask their presence from the sea kings and can simply 
				pass through the calm belts. All other ships are forced to take a more dangerous route, going through a mountain 
				at the first intersection of the Grand Line and the Red Line, a canal system known as Reverse Mountain 
				(リヴァース・マウンテン Rivāsu Maunten). Sea water from each of the four seas runs up that mountain and merges at the 
				top to flow down a fifth canal and into the first half of the Grand Line. The second half of the Grand Line, 
				beyond the second intersection with the Red Line, is known as the New World (新世界 Shin Sekai).</p>
				<p>The currents and weather of the Grand Line's open sea are extremely unpredictable, whereas in the vicinity 
				of islands the climate is stable. The magnetic fields within the Grand Line cause normal compasses to malfunction,
				making it even more difficult to navigate, and instead a special compass called a Log Pose (記録指針ログポース Rogu Pōsu
				must be used. The Log Pose functions by locking on to one island's magnetic field and then locking on to another 
				island's magnetic field. The time for it to set depends on the island. This process can be bypassed by obtaining 
				an Eternal Pose (永久指針エターナルポース Etānaru Pōsu), a Log Pose variation that is permanently set to a specific
				island and never changes.</p>
				<p>The world of One Piece includes anachronisms, such as the Transponder Snails (電伝虫 Den-Den Mushi), snail-like
				animals that can be attached to electric equipment and function as rotary phones, fax machines, surveillance cameras,
				and similar devices. Dials (貝ダイアル daiaru), the shells of certain sky-dwelling animals, can be used to store kinetic
				energy, wind, sound, images, heat, and the like and have various applications.</p>

				<h1><a name="anim">Anime</a></h1>
				<p>Toei Animation produces an anime television series based on the One Piece manga. The series, which premiered 
				in Japan on Fuji Television on October 20, 1999, has aired more than 800 episodes, and has been exported to 
				various countries around the world. Two cross-over episodes with the anime adaptation of Toriko were aired. 
				The first of these, which was also the first episode of Toriko, aired on April 3, 2011. A second special, 
				which also crossed over with Dragon Ball Z, aired on April 7, 2013.</p>
				<p>On June 8, 2004, 4Kids Entertainment acquired the license for distribution of One Piece in North America.
				4Kids contracted Viz Media to handle home video distribution. 4Kids' in-house musicians wrote a new background
				score and theme song nicknamed "Pirate Rap". 4Kids' dub mandated edits for content and length, which reduced the
				first 143 episodes into 104. Initially, 4Kids originally created an English version of the first opening theme,
				"We Are!" It premiered in the United States on September 18, 2004, in first-run syndication on the Fox network 
				as part of the weekend programming block Fox Box, and later aired on Cartoon Network on their weekday afternoon
				programming block Toonami in April 2005. Production was halted in 2006 after episode 143/104. Viz also ceased 
				its home video release of the series after volume 11. On July 22, 2010, an interview with Anime News Network and
				Mark Kirk, senior vice-president of digital media for 4Kids Entertainment, revealed that 4Kids acquired One Piece
				as part of a package deal with other anime, and that the company did not screen the series before licensing it. 
				However, once 4Kids realized One Piece was not appropriate for their intended demographic, the company decided
				to edit it into a more child-oriented series until they had an opportunity to legally drop the license. Kirk said
				the experience of producing One Piece "ruined the company's reputation". Since then, 4Kids established a stricter 
				set of guidelines, checks, and balances to determine which anime the company acquires.</p>
				<p>On April 13, 2007, Funimation licensed the series and started production on an English-language release of 
				One Piece. In an interview with voice actor Christopher Sabat, he stated that Funimation had been interested in
				acquiring One Piece from the very beginning, and produced a "test episode," in which Sabat portrayed the character
				of Helmeppo and Eric Vale played the part of the main character, Monkey D. Luffy. (They would later go on to provide
				the English voices for Roronoa Zoro and Sanji, respectively.) After resuming production of the renewed English dub, 
				which featured less censorship because of fewer restrictions on cable programming, Funimation released its first 
				uncut, bilingual DVD box set containing 13 episodes on May 27, 2008. Similarly sized sets followed with fourteen 
				sets released. The Funimation-dubbed episodes premiered on Cartoon Network on September 29, 2007 and aired until 
				its removal on March 22, 2008. On October 28, 2011, Funimation posted a press release on their official website 
				confirming the acquisition of episodes 206–263, and the aspect ratio, beginning with episode 207, would be changed 
				to the 16:9 widescreen format. On May 18, 2013, the uncut series began airing on Adult Swim's revived Toonami late-night
				programming block from episode 207 onward. One Piece was removed from the Toonami block after March 18, 2017.</p>
				<p>In May 2009, Funimation, Toei Animation, Shueisha, and Fuji Television announced they would simulcast stream the
				series within an hour of the weekly Japanese broadcast at no charge. Originally scheduled to begin on May 30, 2009,
				with episode 403, a lack of security resulted in a leak of the episode, and Funimation delayed the offer until episode
				415 on August 29, 2009.</p>
				<p>On February 12, 2013, it was announced that Manga Entertainment would start releasing the Funimation dub of One 
				Piece in the United Kingdom in a DVD box set format. Crunchyroll began simulcasting the series on November 2, 2013,
				for the United States, Canada, South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, and Latin America.</p>

				<h1><a name="mng">Manga</a></h1>
				<p>Written and illustrated by Eiichiro Oda, One Piece has been serialized in the manga anthology Weekly Shōnen 
				Jump since July 22, 1997. The chapters have been collected into tankōbon volumes by Shueisha since December 
				24, 1997. In total, there are 914 chapters and 89 tankōbon volumes. Oda teamed up with Akira Toriyama to create
				a single crossover of One Piece and Toriyama's Dragon Ball. Entitled Cross Epoch, the one-shot was published in
				the December 25, 2006, issue of Weekly Shōnen Jump and the April 2011 issue of the English Shonen Jump. Oda 
				collaborated with Mitsutoshi Shimabukuro, author of Toriko, for a crossover one-shot of their series titled 
				Taste of the Devil Fruit (実食! 悪魔の実!! Jitsushoku! Akuma no Mi!!, lit. "The True Food! Devil Fruit!!"),
				which ran in the April 4, 2011, issue of Weekly Shōnen Jump. The spinoff series One Piece Party 
				(ワンピースパーティー Wan Pīsu Pātī), written by Ei Andō in a super deformed art style, began serialization in the 
				January 2015 issue of Saikyō Jump.</p>
				<p>The One Piece manga was licensed for an English language release by Viz Media, who published it via chapters
				in the manga anthology Shonen Jump, since the magazine's launch in November 2002, and in bound volumes since 
				June 30, 2003. In 2009, Viz announced the release of five volumes per month during the first half of 2010 to 
				catch up with the serialization in Japan. Following the discontinuation of the print Shonen Jump, Viz began releasing
				One Piece chapterwise in its digital successor Weekly Shonen Jump on January 30, 2012. In the United Kingdom, 
				the volumes were published by Gollancz Manga, starting in March 2006, until Viz Media took it over after the 
				fourteenth volume. In Australia and New Zealand, the English volumes have been distributed by Madman Entertainment
				since November 10, 2008.</p>
				<p>In Poland, Japonica Polonica Fantastica is publishing the manga, Glénat in France, Panini Comics in Mexico,
				LARP Editores and later by Ivrea in Argentina, Planeta de Libros in Spain, and Edizioni Star Comics in Italy.
