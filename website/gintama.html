				<h1><a name="sory">Plot</a></h1>
				<p>The story is set in an alternate late-Edo period, where humanity is attacked by aliens called "Amanto" 
				(天人, "Sky People"), and the samurai of Japan join the battle against the aliens, but when the shōgun 
				realizes the power of aliens, he betrays the samurai and surrenders to the aliens. The shōgun writes an 
				unequal contract with aliens which allows the aliens to enter the country and places a ban on carrying swords 
				in public. The swords of samurai are taken away so they can no longer resist the aliens. After that, the 
				shogunate becomes a puppet government.</p>
				<p>The plot is focused on an eccentric samurai, Gintoki Sakata (a.k.a. Odd Jobs Gin), who helps a teenager 
				named Shinpachi Shimura save his sister Tae from a group of aliens who want to make her part of a brothel. 
				Impressed with Gintoki, Shinpachi becomes his apprentice and works with him as a freelance odd-jobs man in 
				order to pay the monthly rent on Gintoki's combination home and office, as well as to know more about him. 
				The two of them rescue a teenage alien girl named Kagura from a group of Yakuza who wanted to use her superhuman 
				strength to kill people. Kagura joins Shinpachi and Gintoki to work as freelancers and the three become known as 
				"Yorozuya" (万事屋, "We do everything" or literally "The Anything Store").</p>
				<p>While doing their job, they encounter the police force Shinsengumi several times, who normally ally with 
				Odd Jobs Gin in their work since the jobs commonly involve dangerous criminals. They eventually meet some of 
				Gintoki's former comrades from the fight against the Amanto's invasion, including the revolutionary Kotaro Katsura 
				who maintains a friendly relationship with them despite his terrorist activities against the bakufu. On the 
				other hand, Shinsuke Takasugi acts as a major antagonist throughout the series, as he wants to destroy the bakufu
				and sees his former comrades as enemies.</p>
				<p>Although the series' story is commonly episodic, there are also a few story arcs which are developed through
				several chapters. Across several story arcs Takasugi starts gaining allies including Kagura's brother, Kamui,
				and the elite unit Mimawarigumi to prepare for his large scale coup d'état.</p>
				<p>Following the assassination of the ruling shōgun, Shige Shige Tokugawa, the Shinsengumi rebel against the 
				new shōgun Hitotsubashi Nobunobu.</p>
				<p>After the Introduction of Utsuro as the shows main villain during the 'Farewell, Shinsengumi' arc, the plot 
				then shifts to Gintoki along with his friends and enemies trying to stop Utsuro from destroying both Earth 
				and the Universe.</p>

				<h1><a name="anim">Anime</a></h1>
				<p>An anime adaptation by Sunrise debuted on TV Tokyo on April 4, 2006. The first ninety-nine episodes were 
				initially directed by Shinji Takamatsu. Episodes 100 to 105 were directed by Takamatsu and Yoichi Fujita, while 
				the following episodes are being directed only by Fujita. The subtitle for the Gintama anime could be loosely 
				translated as "The starting point is the utmost importance for anything, so trying to outdo oneself is just 
				about right." During January 2009, Fujita mentioned he was not going to work in the fourth season of the series
				starting in such year. However, in February 2009, it was confirmed that the anime would continue for a fourth year,
				once again directed by Fujita. The series ended on March 25, 2010 with a total of 201 episodes.</p>
				<p>In Japan, Aniplex distributes the anime in DVD format. A total of thirteen volumes were released for the first 
				season, between July 26, 2006 and June 26, 2007. The second season was released over another set of thirteen 
				volumes between July 25, 2007 and July 23, 2008. Season 3 was also released in thirteen volumes from August 27, 
				2008 to August 26, 2009. The fourth season was collected released in thirteen DVD volumes from October 28, 2009
				to October 27, 2010.</p>
				<p>In November 2008, an agreement was reached between TV Tokyo and the streaming video service Crunchyroll. Crunchyroll 
				would stream English-subtitled episodes for free one week after they had aired in Japan. Paying subscribers can watch new
				episodes an hour after they air in Japan. On January 8, 2009, Crunchyroll uploaded their first episode (episode 129) to
				the service. Alongside new episodes each week, Crunchyroll also uploads episodes from the beginning of the series.
				The anime is licensed in North America by Sentai Filmworks, with distribution from Section23 Films. Section23 Films' Chris
				Oarr commented that only the first two seasons were licensed, with an option on the rest. The first collection 
				containing thirteen English-subtitled episodes was released on DVD, April 27, 2010. Only 49 episodes were released before 
				the releases stalled. However, shortly after licensing the Gin Tama film, Sentai Filmworks announced that based on the 
				film's performance, they would consider releasing more of the series in North America, possibly with an English dub.
				An English subtitled version of the series began airing on Shorts HD on July 12, 2015. On July 1, 2016, Crunchyroll 
				announced that they will re-release the series on Blu-ray and DVD with an English dub.</p>
