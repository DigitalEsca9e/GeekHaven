				<h1><a name="sory">Plot</a></h1>
				<p>The world of Earth-land is home to numerous guilds where skilled wizards apply their magical abilities 
				for paid job requests. Natsu Dragneel, a dragon slayer wizard from the Fairy Tail guild, explores the 
				Kingdom of Fiore in search of his missing adoptive father, the dragon Igneel. During his journey, he 
				befriends a young celestial wizard named Lucy Heartfilia and invites her to join Fairy Tail. Lucy forms a 
				team with Natsu and his cat-like Exceed partner, Happy, which is joined by other guild members: 
				Gray Fullbuster, an ice wizard; Erza Scarlet, a magical knight; and Wendy Marvell and Carla, another dragon 
				slayer and Exceed duo. The team embark on numerous missions together, which include subduing criminals, 
				illegal dark guilds, and ancient Etherious demons created by the immortal dark wizard Zeref.</p>
				<p>After several adventures, Natsu and his companions encounter Zeref living in isolation on the guild's 
				sacred ground of Sirius Island. A battle over Zeref ensues between Fairy Tail and the dark guild Grimoire 
				Heart, which attracts the attention of the evil black dragon Acnologia. The Fairy Tail wizards survive 
				Acnologia's assault when the spirit of their guild's founder and Zeref's estranged lover, Mavis Vermillion, 
				casts the defensive Fairy Sphere spell that places them into seven years of suspended animation. After later 
				participating in the Grand Magic Games tournament, Fairy Tail wages war against Tartaros, a dark guild of 
				Etherious that aim to unseal a book believed to contain E.N.D., Zeref's ultimate demon. Acnologia returns to 
				annihilate both guilds, prompting Igneel – revealed to have sealed himself within Natsu – to emerge and battle 
				Acnologia. However, Acnologia kills Igneel in front of a helpless Natsu, who departs on a training journey 
				to avenge Igneel.</p>
