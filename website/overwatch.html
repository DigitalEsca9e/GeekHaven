				<h1><a name="sory">Overview</a></h1>
				<p>Overwatch is a team-based multiplayer first-person shooter video game developed and published by Blizzard Entertainment,
				which released on May 24, 2016 for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Windows. Described as a "hero shooter", Overwatch assigns
				players into two teams of six, with each player selecting from a roster of nearly 30 characters, known as "heroes", each
				with a unique style of play whose roles are divided into three general categories that fit their role. Players on a team work
				together to secure and defend control points on a map or escort a payload across the map in a limited amount of time. Players
				gain cosmetic rewards that do not affect gameplay, such as character skins and victory poses, as they play the game. The game 
				was initially launched with casual play, with a competitive ranked mode, various 'arcade' game modes, and a player-customizable
				server browser subsequently included following its release. Additionally, Blizzard has added new characters, maps, and game 
				modes post-release, all free of charge, with the only additional cost to players being optional loot boxes to earn cosmetic 
				items.</p>

				<h1><a name="anim">Gameplay</a></h1>
				<p>Overwatch features a number of different game modes, principally designed around squad-based combat with two opposing teams 
				of six players each. Players select one of over two dozen pre-made hero characters from one of three class types: Damage heroes 
				that deal most of the damage to attack or defend control points, Tank heroes that can absorb a large amount of damage, and Support
				heroes that provide healing or other buffs for their teammates.= Each hero has a unique skill kit, defining their intrinsic 
				attributes like health points and running speed, their primary attacks, several active and passive skills, and an ultimate ability
				that can only be used after it has been charged through dealing damage. Players can change their hero during the course of a match, 
				as a goal of Overwatch's design was to encourage dynamic team compositions that adapt to the situation. The game's genre has been 
				described by some journalists as a "hero shooter", due to its design around specific heroes and classes.</p>
				<p>The game features game modes for casual play, competitive ranked play, and for supporting esports competitions including Blizzard's
				Overwatch League. These modes generally are centered around sequentially securing control of points on the map, 
				or escorting a payload between points on the map, with one team attacking while the other defends. Other modes set aside for casual 
				matches include solo and team deathmatch, capture-the-flag, and unique modes run during various seasonal events. Regardless of winning
				or losing a match, players gain experience towards a player level, and on gaining a new level, receive loot boxes that contain cosmetic
				items that they can use to customize the appearance of the hero characters but otherwise does not affect gameplay. Loot boxes can also
				be purchased through microtransactions.</p>

				<h1><a name="mng">Reception</a></h1>
				<p>Before its release, Overwatch experienced a period of pre-launch attention not typically expected; Game Revolution noted that 
				"[Overwatch's] reputation has quickly permeated through cyberspace, attracting attention from people who may not traditionally 
				put down $40 to $60 each time a new first-person shooter releases." The game's open beta, which attracted 9.7 million players, 
				was very heavily covered by the media.</p>
				<p>Overwatch received "universal acclaim" upon release, according to review aggregator Metacritic. IGN's Vince Ingenito praised 
				the game's characters and maps, writing "Overwatch takes just about every possible opportunity to make its cast and locales seem
				like people and places rather than puppets and scenery." Ingenito added that the game has a "strong online experience that gets 
				you into games quickly and reliably." The Verge's Andrew Webster praised Overwatch and previous titles Titanfall and Splatoon as 
				"friendly online shooters" that have room for both new and casual players who may not desire to master the game but can still
				compete fairly with others, and for expert players that can utilize the various heroes to adapt to the dynamic tactics of the game.
				Webster went on to cite the atmosphere of Overwatch as a reason for the game's approachability, writing, "The first thing that makes 
				Overwatch's world appealing and approachable is, well, its world. This isn't the dour brown-and-grey shooter you might be used to.
				Instead, it's bright and colorful, with a cast of characters that's eclectic and diverse." Caty McCarthy of Kill Screen echoed 
				similar thoughts, writing "When playing Overwatch, the player is absorbed by its radiating positivity. It's a world filled with 
				lively color and energetic, playful competition, much like Nintendo's creative kid-friendly ink-shooter Splatoon." Mike Minotti 
				of VentureBeat commending the team-based gameplay, the game's diverse character roster and colorful settings, as well as the 
				unlockable cosmetics earned through level progression and the smooth server connection. Referencing its similarities to Team 
				Fortress 2, Minotti confirmed that "[Overwatch has] distinct classes, the team- and objective-based combat, and a bright, 
				cartoon-like art style," and that "Overwatch certainly takes plenty of inspiration from Valve's online shooter series," but 
				opines that "[Overwatch is] just better."[92] Daniel Tack of The News & Observer positively received the game, expressing 
				that "no matter what happens – win or lose – you’re going to have fun," adding that "the game's strength lies in its simplicity 
				and polish." Tack went on to praise the game's characters, writing "Unforgettable characters are the lifeblood and driving 
				force of Overwatch." The Denver Post's Hugh Johnson lauded the game for its emphasis on characters, rather than focusing
				on traditional first-person shooter tropes, such as weapon load outs and incremental level upgrades. Johnson went on to insist 
				that the characters are balanced writing, "The big question with class-based shooters like these is whether or not the characters 
				are balanced," expressing that "some characters are naturally better, but no character is so overpowered that their mere presence 
				spells doom for their opponents." In June 2016, Vulture's Joshua Rivera listed Overwatch as one of the "best video games of 2016 
				(so far)," writing, "It's hard to separate Overwatch the game from Overwatch the phenomenon — and why bother, both 
				are fascinating."</p>
