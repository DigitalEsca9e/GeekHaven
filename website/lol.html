				<h1><a name="sory">Overview</a></h1>
				<p>League of Legends (abbreviated LoL) is a multiplayer online battle arena video game developed and published by Riot 
				Games for Microsoft Windows and macOS. The game follows a freemium model and is supported by microtransactions, and was
				inspired by the Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne mod, Defense of the Ancients.</p>
				<p>In League of Legends, players assume the role of an unseen "summoner" that controls a "champion" with unique 
				abilities and battle against a team of other players or computer-controlled champions. The goal is usually to destroy 
				the opposing team's "nexus", a structure that lies at the heart of a base protected by defensive structures, although 
				other distinct game modes exist as well. Each League of Legends match is discrete, with all champions starting off 
				fairly weak but increasing in strength by accumulating items and experience over the course of the game. The champions
				and setting blend a variety of elements, including high fantasy, steampunk, and Lovecraftian horror.</p>

				<h1><a name="anim">Gameplay</a></h1>
				<p>League of Legends is a 3D, third-person multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game. The game consists of three current 
				running game modes: Summoner's Rift, Twisted Treeline, and Howling Abyss. Another game mode, The Crystal Scar, has since been 
				removed. Players compete in matches, lasting anywhere from 20 to 60 minutes on average. In each game mode, teams work 
				together to achieve a victory condition, typically destroying the core building (called the Nexus) in the enemy team's 
				base after bypassing a line of defensive structures called turrets, or towers.</p>
				<p>In all game modes, players control characters called champions, chosen or assigned every match, who each have a set of 
				unique abilities. Champions begin every match at a low level, and then gain experience over the course of the match to 
				achieve a maximum level of 18. Gaining champion levels in matches allows players to unlock their champion's special 
				abilities and augment them in a number of ways unique to each character. If a champion loses all their health, they are defeated
				, but are automatically revived in their base after enough time passes. Players also begin each match with a low amount of gold,
				and can earn additional gold throughout the match in a variety of ways: by killing non-player characters known as minions and 
				monsters; by killing or helping to kill enemy players; by destroying enemy structures; passively over time; and through 
				unique item interactions or champion abilities. This gold can then be spent throughout the match to buy in-game items that 
				further augment each champion's abilities and game play in a variety of ways. Champion experience, gold earned, and items 
				bought are specific to each match and do not carry over to subsequent matches. Thus, all players begin each match 
				on more-or-less equal footing relative to their opposing team.</p>
				<p>Across matches, players also earn rewards that are applied to their account. Player accounts begin at level one and 
				progress onward with games played. Player level is separate from character level; both a level 30 account and a level 
				5 account would begin at character level 1 at the start of a new game. From 2009–2017, the maximum account level was 
				30, and as players progressed, they unlocked additional content and abilities. This system was reworked in November 
				2017, with the removal of the level 30 limit and removal of a Runes / Masteries system that gave progressive bonuses 
				to players based on their account level. Playing matches and leveling up provides "Blue Essence" (called "Influence Points" 
				(IP) from 2009–2017), a currency that can be used in lieu of "real money" to access certain locked features.</p>
				<p>Accounts are given rankings based on the Elo rating system, with proprietary adjustments. These ratings are used 
				in automated matchmaking to make games with players of comparable skill level on each team.</p>

				<h1><a name="mng">Reception</a></h1>
				<p>League of Legends received generally favorable reviews, according to review aggregator Metacritic. IGN initially 
				awarded League of Legends an 8 out of 10 in 2009, highlighting an enjoyable game design, inventive champion design 
				with good customization options, and lively visuals. However, the game's confusing launch was criticized: it was felt that 
				the title was released too early, with some features missing and others to be removed. Finally, the reviewer noted that 
				high level players in the game have "little patience for newcomers", though the reviewer believed that matchmaking 
				(not implemented at the time of review) would solve the problem by matching players of similar level together.</p>
				<p>Leah B. Jackson of IGN re-reviewed the game in 2014, changing IGN's score from 8.0 to 9.2. Jackson hailed the game 
				"as an example of excellence", praising the variety of champions, rewarding progression systems, and fast but intensely 
				strategic team play. As compared to fellow MOBA games Heroes of Newerth and Dota 2, Mike Minotti of VentureBeat considered 
				League of Legends as the easiest to learn and to have fastest gameplay pace of the three, while the other two feature more 
				complex gameplay mechanics and are considered closer in style to the original DoTA All-Stars. In 2015, the game placed 
				15th on USgamer's The 15 Best Games Since 2000 list.</p>
				<p>In November 2011, Riot Games stated that League of Legends had accumulated 32.5 million players, 11.5 million of whom 
				play monthly, of which 4.2 million play daily. Riot said in October 2013, the game had 12 million active daily players 
				and 32 million active monthly players. In January 2014, the game had 27 million active daily players, 7.5 million concurrent 
				players at peak times, and 67 million active monthly players. Global concurrent users online peaked at over 5 million players
				as of March 2013.</p>
				<p>By March 2012, League of Legends had become the #1 title in Korean PC cafés. League continues to be popular in Korea; it 
				remained the #1 game until the middle of 2016, when Overwatch displaced it, and is still the #2 game (disclaimer: these 
				numbers do not include home playership rates). In July 2012, Xfire released a report stating that League of Legends 
				was the most played PC game in North America and Europe, with 1.3 billion hours logged by players in those regions between 
				July 2011 and June 2012. League of Legends is also popular in the Philippines, and was the second most played game in 
				internet cafés in the country in June 2013, behind Defense of the Ancients. In Taiwan, it is estimated that almost five
				percent of the entire population had played the game by 2016, with almost a million players subscribed on the server.</p>
