				<h1><a name="sory">Plot</a></h1>
				<p>A powerful fox known as the Nine-Tails attacks Konoha, the hidden leaf village in the Land of Fire, 
				one of the Five Great Shinobi Countries in the Ninja World. In response, the leader of Konoha, the Fourth 
				Hokage, seals the fox inside the body of his newborn son, Naruto Uzumaki, making Naruto a host of the beast
				; this costs Naruto's father his life, and the Third Hokage returns from retirement to become leader of 
				Konoha again. Naruto is often ridiculed by the Konoha villagers for being the host of the Nine-Tails. Because 
				of a decree made by the Third Hokage forbidding anyone to mention these events, Naruto knows nothing about the
				Nine-Tails until 12 years later, when Mizuki, a renegade ninja, reveals the truth to Naruto. Naruto then defeats
				Mizuki in combat, earning the respect of his teacher Iruka Umino.</p>
				<p>Shortly afterwards, Naruto becomes a ninja and joins with Sasuke Uchiha, against whom he often competes, 
				and Sakura Haruno, on whom he has a crush, to form Team 7, under an experienced sensei, the elite ninja Kakashi Hatake.
				Like all the ninja teams from every village, Team 7 completes missions requested by the villagers, ranging from doing
				chores and being bodyguards to performing assassinations.</p>
				<p>After several missions, including a major one in the Land of Waves, Kakashi allows Team 7 to take a ninja exam,
				enabling them to advance to a higher rank and take on more difficult missions, known as Chunin Exams. During the 
				exams, Orochimaru, a wanted criminal, invades Konoha and kills the Third Hokage for revenge. Jiraiya, one of the 
				three legendary ninjas, declines the title of Fifth Hokage and searches with Naruto for Tsunade whom he chooses to 
				become Fifth Hokage instead.</p>
				<p>During the search, it is revealed that Orochimaru wishes to train Sasuke because of his powerful genetic heritage, 
				the Sharingan. After Sasuke attempts and fails to kill his older brother Itachi when he showed up in Konoha to kidnap Naruto,
				he joins Orochimaru, hoping to gain from him the strength needed to kill Itachi. The story takes a turn when Sasuke leaves 
				the Konoha village and when Tsunade finds out, she sends a group of ninja, including Naruto, to retrieve Sasuke,
				but Naruto is unable to persuade or force him to come back. Naruto and Sakura do not give up on Sasuke: Naruto leaves 
				Konoha to receive training from Jiraiya to prepare himself for the next time he encounters Sasuke, while Sakura becomes 
				Tsunade's apprentice.</p>
				<p>Two and a half years later, Naruto returns from his training with Jiraiya. The Akatsuki starts kidnapping the hosts 
				of the powerful Tailed Beasts. Team 7 and other Leaf ninja fight against them and search for their teammate Sasuke. The Akatsuki
				succeeds in capturing and extracting seven of the Tailed Beasts, killing all the hosts except Gaara, who is now the Kazekage. 
				Meanwhile, Sasuke betrays Orochimaru and faces Itachi to take revenge. After Itachi dies in battle, Sasuke learns from the Akatsuki
				founder Tobi that Itachi received an order from Konoha's superiors to destroy his clan to prevent a coup. He accepted it on the condition 
				that he would be allowed to spare Sasuke. Saddened by this revelation, Sasuke joins the Akatsuki to destroy Konoha in 
				revenge. As Konoha ninjas defeat several Akatsuki members, the Akatsuki figurehead leader, Nagato, kills Jiraiya and devastates
				Konoha, but Naruto defeats and redeems him, earning the village's respect and admiration.</p>
				<p>With Nagato's death, Tobi, disguised as Madara Uchiha (one of Konoha's founding fathers), announces that he wants to capture 
				all nine Tailed Beasts to perform an illusion powerful enough to control all humanity and achieve world peace. The leaders of the 
				five ninja villages refuse to help him and instead join forces to confront Tobi and his allies. That decision results in a Fourth
				Shinobi World War between the combined armies of the Five Great Countries (known as the Allied Shinobi Forces) and Akatsuki's forces
				of zombie-like ninjas. The Five Kage try to keep Naruto, unaware of the war, in a secret island turtle near Kumogakure 
				(Hidden Cloud Village), but Naruto finds out and escapes from the island with Killer Bee, the host of the Eight-Tails. At that 
				time, Naruto — along with the help of Killer Bee — gains control of his Tailed Beast and the two of them head for the battlefield.</p>
				<p>During the conflict, it is revealed that Tobi is Obito Uchiha, a former teammate of Kakashi's who was thought to be dead. 
				The real Madara saved Obito's life, and they have since collaborated. As Sasuke learns the history of Konoha, including the circumstances
				that led to his clan's downfall, he decides to protect the village and rejoins Naruto and Sakura to thwart Madara and Obito's plans.
				However, Madara's body ends up possessed by Kaguya Otsutsuki, an ancient princess who intends to subdue all humanity. 
				A reformed Obito sacrifices himself to help Team 7 stop her. Once Kaguya is sealed, Madara dies as well. Sasuke takes advantage of the 
				situation and takes control of all the Tailed Beasts, as he reveals his goal of ending the current village system. Naruto confronts
				Sasuke to dissuade him from his plan, and after they almost kill each other in a final battle, Sasuke admits defeat and reforms. 
				After the war, Kakashi becomes the Sixth Hokage and pardons Sasuke for his crimes. Years later, Kakashi steps down while Naruto 
				marries Hinata Hyuga and becomes the Seventh Hokage, raising the next generation.</p>
