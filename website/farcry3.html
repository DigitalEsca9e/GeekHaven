				<p>Far Cry 3 is an open world action-adventure first-person shooter video game developed by Ubisoft Montreal and published by Ubisoft 
				for Microsoft Windows, Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3. The game was released on November 29, 2012 in Australia, November 30 in the UK,

				<p>Far Cry 3 is set on a tropical island between the Indian and Pacific Oceans. After a vacation goes awry, protagonist Jason Brody must 
				save his friends, who have been kidnapped by pirates and escape from the island and its unhinged inhabitants.</p>
				<p>The third installment in the Far Cry series, Far Cry 3 was critically acclaimed upon release, with reviewers praising its world design,
				open-ended gameplay and story, while the game's multiplayer mode was criticized. Following the game's success, Ubisoft announced a successor,
				Far Cry 4.</p>

				<h1><a name="anim">Gameplay</a></h1>
				<p>Far Cry 3 is a first-person shooter, which also features role-playing game elements including experience points, skill trees,
				and a crafting system. The player has the ability to take cover behind objects to break enemies' lines of sight and to peek around 
				and over cover and blindfire. The player has the ability to perform silent takedowns by performing melee attacks from above, 
				below, or close behind. The game's narrative director, Jason Vandenberghe, said that the story mode map is around ten times larger 
				than the game's previous installments. Players are given the ability to survey and plan out their attacks with stealth takedown 
				combinations and tag enemies with the camera in order to track their movement once they break the player's line of sight.</p>
				<p>Equipment is controlled by a simple system. As missions are completed, new items are unlocked to be purchased or crafted by Jason,
				using the pelts of various animals found around the island to improve items, weapons, and ammunition carrying capabilities. When 
				scramblers on radio towers are removed, areas of the map are opened and weapons in the shop are first made available for purchase, 
				and ultimately made available for free. Apart from the basic models of each category which can be picked up from slain enemies or 
				at the start of several missions, most weapons can be upgraded with one or more additions such as silencers, larger magazines, 
				and better optics. A special group of "signature" weapons possess maxed-out statistics and/or unique abilities. Apart from guns, 
				the player also has access to a few unique items and tools. Ammunition for each weapon category can be picked up, or, in the case of arrows,
				retrieved after use.</p>
				<p>As outposts of Vaas' pirate group are attacked and retaken, the vicinity around the outpost becomes safer and new side quests are 
				unlocked for that area, involving missions like hunting the many different wildlife species on the island to upgrade one's equipment.</p>
				<p>Skills are collected by gaining experience from completing missions and killing enemies, and are unlocked in 
				three skill trees, which correspond to the Spider, the Heron, and the Shark. Each skill tree upgrades different aspects of Jason's 
				abilities, with the Spider upgrading his stealth takedowns and hunting skills, the Shark upgrading assault takedowns and health, 
				and the Heron upgrading his long-range takedowns and mobility. As skills are collected, the tribal tattoo on Jason's forearm grows 
				correspondingly.</p>

				<h1><a name="mng">Reception</a></h1>
				<p>Far Cry 3 received widespread critical acclaim. Aggregating review websites GameRankings and Metacritic gave the PlayStation 
				3 version 89.18% and 90/100, the Xbox 360 version 89.14% and 90/100 and the PC version 88.12% and 88/100.</p>
				<p>The game was highly praised by Eurogamer, who awarded it a 10/10, claiming that "Far Cry 3 is all the best things about 
				open-world gaming". Edge also added to the praise, calling the game "wild, reactive and unpredictable", giving Far Cry 3 an 8/10.
				G4TV gave the game a 5/5, praising the game's open world, long and satisfying campaign missions, solid gunplay with a variety of 
				weapons to unlock and customize, and a compelling story. Game Informer gave the game a score of 9.0/10, praising the game's story, 
				characters, open world exploration, and gameplay.GameTrailers gave the game an 8.6/10, criticizing the repetitive feel of the island,
				but praising the story, characters and its likeness to Assassin's Creed. IGN gave the game a 9.0/10, praising the game's excellent 
				cast of characters, unpredictable enemy encounters, and its open world environment.</p>
				<p>Parts of the story were not universally praised; some commentators found the story unrealistic, the player and his companions 
				unlikeable, and the inconsistency of the plot's tone awkward. The game also received criticism surrounding the main character, 
				Jason Brody, being a white individual who came to the rescue of the indigenous population as a textbook example of the white 
				savior trope. This was acknowledged by narrative director Mike Thompson in an interview. Thompson spoke about how he and his 
				team learned a lot from those missteps and used those experiences to help determine their direction for Far Cry 4.</p>
