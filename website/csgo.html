				<h1><a name="sory">Overview</a></h1>
				<p>Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO) is a multiplayer first-person shooter video game developed by 
				Hidden Path Entertainment and Valve Corporation. It is the fourth game in the Counter-Strike series and 
				was released for Microsoft Windows, OS X, Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3 in August 2012, with the Linux version 
				released in September 2014. The game pits two teams against each other: the Terrorists and the Counter-Terrorists.
				Both sides are tasked with eliminating the other while also completing separate objectives, the Terrorists, 
				depending on the game mode, must either plant the bomb or defend the hostages, while the Counter-Terrorists must 
				either prevent the bomb from being planted, defuse the bomb, or rescue the hostages. There are eight game modes, 
				all of which have distinct characteristics specific to that mode.</p>

				<h1><a name="anim">Gameplay</a></h1>
				<p>Global Offensive, like prior games in the Counter-Strike series, is an objective-based, multiplayer first-person
				shooter. Two opposing teams, known as the Terrorists and the Counter Terrorists, compete in game modes to complete 
				objectives, such as securing a location to plant or defuse a bomb and rescuing or guarding hostages. At the end of 
				each round, players are rewarded based on their individual performance with in-game currency to spend on more powerful 
				weapons in subsequent rounds. Winning rounds results in more money than losing, and completing objectives such as 
				killing enemy players gives cash bonuses. Uncooperative actions, such as killing teammates, results in a penalty.</p>
				<p>There are five categories of purchasable weapons, four being guns and the final being utilities: rifles, sub-machine 
				guns (SMGs), heavy, pistols, and grenades. All guns have different stats and all grenade types have different in-game 
				effects. The hand grenade deals damage in a small radius, the smoke grenade temporarily places a smoke screen, the 
				decoy grenade emulates the player's primary gun, the flashbang temporarily blinds players who look at it explode, and 
				the Molotov cocktail and Incendiary Grenade set a small radius of the map on fire for a short period of time. Alongside 
				all of these weapons, the Zeus x27, a taser, can also be purchased.</p>
				<p>Global Offensive contains eight main game modes: Competitive, Casual, Deathmatch, Arms Race, Demolition, Wingman, 
				Flying Scoutsman, and Weapons Course. Competitive mode pits competitive players against each other in two teams of 
				five and roughly 45-minute matches. The Casual and Deathmatch modes are less serious than the Competitive modes, 
				and do not register friendly fire against or collision with other players on the player's team. Both are primarily 
				used for practice. Arms Race mode is similar to the "Gun Game" mod for other games in the series. It consists of players racing to 
				upgrade their guns via killing enemies. Demolition mode is again like the "Gun Game" mod though players are able to plant 
				and defuse the bomb too, and only receive a gun upgrade at the start of the round if they killed an enemy the last round.
				Wingman is a two-on-two bomb defusal game-mode taking place over fifteen rounds. It is similar to Competitive in the sense
				that players are paired based on their skill levels. Flying Scoutsman is a low-gravity mode in which players are equipped
				only with a SSG 08 and a knife. The Flying Scoutsman, Demolition, and Arms Race game modes are placed in the War Games tab.
				The Weapons Course is an offline practice mode designed to help new players learn how to use grenades and guns, and learning
				how to defuse and plant the bomb. Apart from the Weapons Course, all seven other game modes can be played online or offline.</p>

				<h1><a name="mng">Reception</a></h1>
				<p>Counter-Strike: Global Offensive received generally positive reception from critics, according to review aggregator Metacritic.
				Since the game's release, Global Offensive has been steadily at the top of the Steam charts in terms of most concurrent players.
				The game won the fan's choice "eSports Game of the Year" award at The Game Awards 2015.</p>
				<p>Reviewers praised Global Offensive's faithfulness to the previous game, Counter-Strike: Source, with Allistair Pinsof of 
				Destructoid rating the game very highly and saying that Global Offensive is a "polished and better looking" version of the game.
				GameSpot writer Eric Neigher said in their review that this game stays true to its predecessors by adding lots of content, but
				tweaking small amounts and retaining their best features. The reviewers at gamesTM wrote in their review that the game stood 
				"as a glowing reminder that quality game design is rewarded in longevity and variety." They also continued onto congratulate 
				Valve that they had not only updated the popular game, but "had completely outclassed its contemporaries." Martin Gaston of 
				VideoGamer.com wrote that although he was too old to truly enjoy the game, he believed that it was a "fine installment of 
				one of the best games ever made," and that some people will experience "what will become the definitive moments of their 
				gaming lives." Xav de Matos for Engadget wrote that for the price, "Global Offensive is a great extension to that legacy."
				Mitch Dyer from IGN said that "Global Offensive is definitely a Counter-Strike sequel â€“ it looks and feels familiar, 
				with minor tweaks here and there to help balance old issues and surprise longtime players."</p>
